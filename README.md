# Sam’s Homelab & Infrastructure Journey
A long-term documentation project of how I evolved from building my first PC at 15 
to designing multi-site VPNs, dynamic routing, storage architecture, and self-hosted services.

This repository is both:
- a **technical autobiography**, documenting my learning and experiments over the years  
- a **reference library** for the systems, networks, and services I run today  

If you're exploring, start with the overview below.

## 📘 Start Here — Overview of the Journey
To understand the full story, begin with the high-level summary:

➡️ **[00 – Overview](docs/00-overview.md)**

## 📚 Full Chapter Index

Each chapter covers a different phase of my development:

- **[01 – Early Years: My First PC & Synology](docs/01-early-years.md)**
- **[02 – Discovering Networking & Storage](docs/02-discovering-networking.md)**
- **[03 – Game Server Era: My Gateway to Linux](docs/03-game-server-era.md)**
- **[04 – Router Firmware & Home Networking](docs/04-router-firmware.md)**
- **[05 – Cabling, CCTV, and Physical Infrastructure](docs/05-cabling-and-cctv.md)**
- **[06 – Multi-Site VPNs](docs/06-multi-site-vpn.md)**
- **[07 – Dynamic Routing with BIRD & OSPF](docs/07-dynamic-routing.md)**
- **[08 – Self-Hosting Services (Nextcloud, LAMP/LEMP)](docs/08-self-hosting.md)**
- **[09 – Learning to Vibe Code & Use AI](docs/09-ai-and-vibecoding.md)**
- **[10 – What’s Next](docs/10-whats-next.md)**

## 🗂️ Technical Documentation & Project Notes
In addition to the story, I maintain deeper technical breakdowns here:

➡️ **[`/projects/`](projects/)**  
Contains personal notes, configs, experiments, and evolving designs for:

- WireGuard mesh + routing  
- Nextcloud setup  
- ZFS storage architecture  
- ACL & permissions  
- Homelab services  

These are *not* polished guides — they are my internal thinking, iterations, 
and experiment logs.

If I later produce clean beginner-friendly instructions, those will live in separate repos.

---

## 🖼️ Images & Diagrams
Visual references are stored here:

- **[`/images/`](images/)** — photos of hardware, cabling, racks, NAS builds  
- **[`/diagrams/`](diagrams/)** — WireGuard topologies, BIRD routing diagrams, etc.

## 🧭 How to Navigate This Repo

This repo contains two types of content:

### **1. My Personal Learning Journey (in `/docs/`)**
A chronological story documenting:
- how I got into Linux & networking  
- the mistakes I made  
- why I chose specific solutions  
- what I learned at each stage  

### **2. Technical Notes & Deep Dives (in `/projects/`)**
These folders contain:
- configs  
- troubleshooting notes  
- architecture drafts  
- experimental designs  
- implementation details of real systems I run  

Think of **/docs** as the narrative  
And **/projects** as the engineering notebook.

## 🔧 What I'm Working on Now
- Improving observability and monitoring  
- Moving toward DevOps/SRE and IaC practices  
- Refining my WireGuard + BIRD multi-site topology  
- Containerisation experiments with Docker and Podman

## 💬 About This Repo
This project evolves with me.  
As I learn, break things, rebuild them, and explore new technologies,  
I document the process here — both for my future self, and anyone who’s curious 
about how real homelabs grow over time.

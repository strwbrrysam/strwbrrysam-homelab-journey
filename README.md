# Sam’s Homelab & Infrastructure Journey
A long-term documentation project of how I evolved from building my first PC at 15 
to designing multi-site VPNs, dynamic routing, storage architecture, and self-hosted services.

This repository is both:
- a **technical autobiography**, documenting my learning and experiments over the years  
- a **reference library** for the systems, networks, and services I run today  

If you're exploring, start with the overview below.

## 🗂️ Technical Documentation & Projects

All hands-on technical work — configs, experiments, topology ideas, and detailed breakdowns —  
lives inside the **`/projects/`** directory.

➡️ **[`/projects/`](projects/)**

Each project is self-contained and may include:

- `images/` — screenshots, hardware photos, wiring diagrams  
- `diagrams/` — network topologies and architecture visuals  
- `configs/` — example configuration files  
- `notes/` — experiments, troubleshooting, design iterations  

Current projects include:

- WireGuard mesh + dynamic routing  
- Nextcloud setup  
- ZFS storage architecture  
- ACL & permissions model  
- Homelab services and automation  

These folders represent my **engineering notebook** — exploratory, iterative, and constantly improving.  
Polished, beginner-friendly guides may eventually become separate public repositories.

## 🧭 How to Navigate This Repo

This repository has two main parts:

### **1. `/my-story/` — My Personal Learning Journey**
A chronological story that explains:

- how I got into Linux, networking, and infrastructure  
- the mistakes and breakthroughs along the way  
- why I built things the way I did  
- how my homelab evolved over time  

This is the narrative side of the repo.

---

### **2. `/projects/` — Technical Deep Dives**
Each project contains:

- architecture drafts  
- experiments and implementation details  
- configuration files  
- troubleshooting notes  
- diagrams and images specific to that project  

Think of **`/docs`** as *the story of my growth*,  
and **`/projects`** as *the technical evidence of that growth*.

---

## 🔧 What I'm Working on Now
- Improving observability and monitoring  
- Moving toward DevOps/SRE and IaC practices  
- Refining my WireGuard + BIRD multi-site topology  
- Containerisation experiments with Docker and Podman

## 💬 About This Repo
This project evolves with me.  
As I learn, break things, rebuild them, and explore new technologies,  
I document the process here — both for my future self, and anyone who’s curious 
about how real homelabs grow over time.

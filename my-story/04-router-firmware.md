# 📡 Router Firmware — DD-WRT, FreshTomato, Merlin

As I grew older, I became the “network fixer” at home and at my parents’ noodle shop.

I discovered the world of custom router firmware and began flashing devices with:

- DD-WRT  
- FreshTomato  
- Asus Merlin  

From here, I learned foundational networking concepts:

- VLANs  
- QoS  
- NAT acceleration  
- static routes  
- OpenVPN modes  
- wireless tuning  
- router hardware limitations  

This was my first exposure to tuning networks intentionally instead of accidentally.

Nowadays, I'm trying to take this to the next level by exploring OSes like OpnSense on more powerful NUCs.
iptables is hard, but I'm getting there!

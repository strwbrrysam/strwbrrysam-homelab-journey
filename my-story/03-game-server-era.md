# 🎮 The Game Server Era — My Gateway Into Linux & Networking

This phase changed everything.

I loved playing Call of Duty 4. 
All the students at my school had to have Macbooks as part of our daily kit. 
We used to "Create a network" on the macbooks and that would create a hotspot of sorts for other Macbooks to connect to, 
so we could play Multiplayer during breaks and on the bus ride.

One day, I decided to host whilst directly connected to the school's Wi-Fi network. 
We discovered that my friends could find the game lobby from another classroom. 
I became the de-facto game host even during class. 
My Macbook fans used to roar and the teachers got suspicious, but I was never busted. 

I convinced my parents to buy me a second computer, but this time, with no discrete GPU and 4x 500GB SSDs. 
I installed Linux for the first time just so I could run a Call of Duty 4 server at home.
Before long, 50–60 kids from different schools in Hong Kong  
were connecting every afternoon. If you were there… Shipment on hardcore  
mode was absolute madness.

This was my first deeper dive into the world of:

- ports and firewalls  
- NAT behaviour  
- TCP/UDP  
- routing quirks  
- service daemons  
- Samba  
- iSCSI  
- linux filesystem and ZFS
- DHCP and DNS  

This was where storage, networking, and Linux all came together.

At one point, I even ran **Windows Server 2016 as a home router**  
just to understand enterprise-style routing concepts in a home environment.  
It was overkill, messy, but extremely educational.

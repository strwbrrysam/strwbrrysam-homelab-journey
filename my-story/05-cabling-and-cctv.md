# 🎥 Hardware Meets Networking — Cabling & CCTV

As an adult, my curiosity left the computer desk.
When I first moved to the UK, I had the opportunity to design and deploy a network from scratch at one of my parent's properties. 

I learned to:

- Drill holes cleanly
- Run conduit
- Terminate ethernet properly
- Deploy CCTV cameras
- Build PoE networks
- Test cable runs
- Place access points and cameras for coverage

This was when I fully understood that the **physical layer** is foundational.

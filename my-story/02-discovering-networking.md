# 🌐 Discovering Networking & Storage

My curiosity for networking started with a very innocent problem:  
**I wanted to access my Synology NAS from outside the house.**

I couldn’t figure it out, so my mum called a guy from a local computer shop —  
the same person who helped our noodle business set up remote CCTV viewing.

He came over and showed me how to **port forward** on the router.

This resulted in… yes… **port-forwarding Samba to the internet**.

Terrible idea — but I didn't know that at the time.  
I was just blown away that it worked.

But it was slow.

And that frustration sparked something in me.

My instinct was: *“Why not plug the NAS directly into the PC?”*  
And I did — and it was fast. Surprisingly fast compared to Wi-Fi.

But since I didn’t know switches existed yet, plugging the NAS directly into the PC meant:

- NAS access worked  
- Internet access stopped
- I couldn't figure out how to make internet traffic default to Wi-Fi while maintaining access to the NAS through the ethernet port. Hey, go easy on me, I wasn't a computer teen prodigy.

I didn’t know how to solve this, so I accepted slow Wi-Fi storage for a while:


Eventually, as I ingested more footage for school media work, I gravitated toward:

- USB-based multi-bay JBODs for on-the-road ingest  
- Using the Synology as cold storage  

It was messy, but functional — and it pushed me deeper into understanding networking and storage.

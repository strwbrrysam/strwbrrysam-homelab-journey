# 📘 Where It Started — Age 15: Building My First PC

My journey really began when I built my first custom PC at 15.  
I put it together for IGCSE Media so I could edit videos, but the truth is  
I barely knew what I was doing — I just knew I wanted to learn.

That first build opened the door to a new world of:

- BIOS tuning  
- airflow and cooling  
- cabling  
- troubleshooting fundamentals  

Not long after, I bought a small 2-bay Synology NAS — my gateway into storage and networking.

This is when I learned that:

- Wi-Fi is not magic  
- Throughput has rules  
- Latency matters  
- Ethernet solves almost everything  

It was the first time I realised that **the network is just as important as the computer**.

## 🌐 Discovering Networking & Storage

My curiosity started with a simple desire:  
**I wanted to access my Synology NAS from outside the house.**

A tech from a local computer shop came over and showed me how to **port-forward**.

This resulted in… yes… **port-forwarding Samba to the internet**.

Terrible idea — but I didn’t know at the time. I was just blown away that it worked.

But it was slow.

And that frustration sparked something in me.

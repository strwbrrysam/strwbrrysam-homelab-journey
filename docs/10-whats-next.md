# 📈 What’s Next

My current areas of focus include:

- strengthening Linux fundamentals  
- adopting DevOps/SRE/IaC practices  
- improving observability & metrics  
- Docker + Podman  
- orchestration (Kubernetes / Nomad)  
- building more resilient multi-site infrastructure  


At this point, my homelab is more than a hobby. It’s a long-running project that reflects:

- how I think
- how I learn
- how I break stuff
- how I fix broken stuff
- how I experiment
- how I build systems from scratch

It shows a progression from curiosity → understanding → architecture → implementation.
I didn’t take a traditional route into tech, but every part of this journey gave me real, 
hands-on experience that matters in the world of Linux, infrastructure, networks, and storage.

It is ongoing — and I intend to turn this passion into a professional career.

## 🙏 Thank You for Reading

I installed LED lights to my motorcycle.
I did it because I ride between Newcastle Upon Tyne and Coventry a lot.
It's 200 miles and often at night.
I have a black bike and wear black gear and helmet.
The amount of times I've almost been hit by a car is insane. 
I don't care if it's tacky, any extra attention on a bike is attentiveness from other road users.
And any level of extra attentiveness is a good thing when I'm the one that will get hurt if I'm hit by a metal box. 
Sue me for being tacky!


The lights are hooked up directly to the battery, with a relay triggered by the acc wire under the seat on the Harley-Davidson Sportster S RH1250.
The wires are double wrapped first in a layer of aluminium foil tape, then automotive cloth tape for both insulation and abrasian resistance. 
Probably overkill for a cheap set of Aliexpress LED lights that only cost a few quid but maybe this will help it last longer.
The part where the wire goes into the LED strip itself is also wrapped tightly in electrical tape to prevent water ingress. 
All LED strips are placed where bulbs are not see unless you get close to the bike.
Keeps the cops off my back!

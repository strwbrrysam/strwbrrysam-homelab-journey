# Operations Cheatsheet Index – My WireGuard + BIRD OSPF Mesh

### WireGuard  
`wg-commands-cheatsheet.md`  
Commands I use to inspect tunnels, restart them, and verify /30 health.

### BIRD OSPF  
`birdc-commands-cheatsheet.md`  
Commands I rely on to check neighbors, route origins, and tunnel MTU/cost issues.

### Routing Debug  
`routing-debug-cheatsheet.md`  
My complete debugging flow when a route disappears, adjacency fails, or tunnels misbehave.
